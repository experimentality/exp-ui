 METAs

 Metadata is data (information) about data. The `<meta>` tag provides metadata about the HTML 
 document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable. 
 Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords, author of 
 the document, last modified, and other metadata.
 ```markup
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title> Title of Page </title>
    <meta name="description" content="Short description, maximum 150 characters">
    <meta name="keywords" content="words,palabra,key"> <!-- separated by commas -->
    <meta name="author" content="Experimentality"> 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- Responsibe meta -->
</head>
 ```

 Open Graph protocol

 The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. 
 For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same 
 functionality as any other object on Facebook.
 ```markup
  <meta property="og:title" content="Title of Page" />
   <meta property="og:description" content="Short description, maximum 150 characters" />
   <meta property="og:title" content="Title of Page" />
   <meta property="og:image:url" content="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/rock.jpg" />
   <meta property="og:image:type " content="image/jpeg" />
   <meta property="og:image:width" content="400" /> <!-- optional -->
   <meta property="og:image:height" content="300" /> <!-- optional -->
 ```

 Titles Manage

 The **H1** tag is typically the largest and most important tag on an individual page of a website. 
 It may be used to introduce the content of that page as a whole—that is, to name the topic at 
 hand—or to simply reflect the name of the page itself. **You should not use more than one H1 on the same page**

/*
 Images ALT

  The alt attribute will accept any text string, but there are certain best practices that will help.
    * No special characters. This includes UTF-8 characters such as unencoded curly quotes, as well as HTML Character Entities.
    * No HTML.
    * No more than 125 characters.
    * Just identify the picture. No need to refer to it (“This is a picture of…”).
  ```markup
    <img src="logo.jpg" alt="Experimentality" />
  ```

 URLs

 **SEO friendly URLs*** are URLs that are designed to meet the needs of users and searchers. 
 Specifically, URLs optimized for SEO tend to be **short and keyword-rich**.
 Along with your title tag, link anchor text, and the content itself, search engines 
 use your webpage’s URL to **understand what your content is** all about.

 SiteMaps

 The Sitemaps protocol allows a webmaster to inform search engines about 
 URLs on a website that are available for crawling. A Sitemap is an XML 
 file that lists the URLs for a site.
```markup
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>http://www.example.net/?id=who</loc>
    <lastmod>2009-09-22</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.8</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>http://www.example.net/?id=what</loc>
    <lastmod>2009-09-22</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.5</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>http://www.example.net/?id=how</loc>
    <lastmod>2009-09-22</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>

/*
 Accesibility

 Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways 
 to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) 
 more accessible to people with disabilities.

 Styleguide SEO.8
*/

/*
 Role & attributes

 Web developers MAY use the ARIA `role` and `aria-*` attributes on HTML elements, 
 in accordance with the requirements described in [wai-aria-1.1], except where these conflict 
 with the strong native semantics or are equal to the implicit ARIA semantics of a given HTML 
 element. These constraints are intended to prevent developers from making assistive technology 
 products report nonsensical user interface (UI) information that does not represent the actual 
 UI of the document.

 # Role

 The Role Attribute defined in this specification allows the author to annotate markup languages 
 with machine-extractable semantic information about the purpose of an element. Use cases 
 include accessibility, device adaptation, server-side processing, and complex data description.
 [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)
```markup
<div role="main">
    <h1>This is the main content of the page</h1>
    <p>Here is some content that is the primary purpose of this web page.</p>
</div>
```

 # States and properties

 Can be applied to elements and are used together to support ARIA roles 
 existing on a page. States can change on their own or with user interaction 
 (i.e. aria-checked and aria-disabled), usually with JavaScript. Properties rarely 
 change once they’re set (i.e. aria-labelledby and aria-describedby).
 [Documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-1.1/states_and_properties)
```markup
  <a aria-label='Read More about how awesome Lullabot is'
    href='/path/to/your/page'>
    Read More
  </a>
  <button id='menu-button-1' 
          aria-haspopup='true' 
          aria-controls='menu-list-1'>
    Menu List 1
  </button>
```

```javascript
// Find the progress bar <div> in the DOM.
 var progressBar = document.getElementById("percent-loaded");

// Set its ARIA roles and states, 
// so that assistive technologies know what kind of widget it is.
 progressBar.setAttribute("role", "progressbar");
 progressBar.setAttribute("aria-valuemin", 0);
 progressBar.setAttribute("aria-valuemax", 100);

// Create a function that can be called at any time to update 
// the value of the progress bar.
 function updateProgress(percentComplete) {
   progressBar.setAttribute("aria-valuenow", percentComplete);
 }
```
